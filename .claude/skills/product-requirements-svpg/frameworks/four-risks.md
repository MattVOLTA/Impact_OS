# The Four Big Risks Framework

Every product effort faces four critical risks. Product managers must understand and assess all four, with explicit ownership of value and viability risks.

## 1. Value Risk

**Definition**: Will customers buy this or choose to use it?

### Key Questions
- Does this solve a real problem customers care about?
- Will customers choose this over alternatives (including doing nothing)?
- What evidence do we have of customer desire?
- How strong is the customer pain point?

### Assessment Criteria
- **High Risk**: No customer validation; assumed pain point; crowded market with strong alternatives
- **Medium Risk**: Some customer feedback; validated problem but unclear solution fit
- **Low Risk**: Strong customer demand; proven willingness to pay/use; differentiated value

### De-Risking Activities
- Customer interviews and observation
- Prototype testing with target users
- Fake door tests (measure interest before building)
- Concierge MVP (manual delivery to validate demand)
- Landing pages with signup to gauge interest

### Red Flags
- "We think customers want this"
- Relying solely on stakeholder or sales requests
- No direct customer contact in last 30 days
- Assuming your opinion represents customer needs

### Evidence to Gather
- Customer quotes demonstrating pain
- Usage data showing current workarounds
- Willingness-to-pay signals
- Competitive win/loss analysis
- NPS and satisfaction scores for related features

## 2. Viability Risk

**Definition**: Does this solution work for our business?

### Key Questions
- Does this align with business strategy and priorities?
- Can we market and sell this effectively?
- Does this meet legal, compliance, privacy requirements?
- Can we support and service this long-term?
- Does this strengthen or weaken our market position?
- What are financial implications (cost, revenue, margins)?

### Stakeholder Considerations

**Sales**: Can they sell it? Does it help close deals? Training needed?

**Marketing**: Can they position it? Does it fit brand and messaging?

**Finance**: What's the business case? ROI timeline? Pricing implications?

**Legal/Compliance**: Any regulatory concerns? Privacy issues? Terms of service changes?

**Support/Success**: Can customers be supported effectively? Documentation and training needs?

**Operations**: Infrastructure and operational requirements? Scale considerations?

**Leadership**: Strategic alignment? Resource allocation justified?

### Assessment Criteria
- **High Risk**: Conflicts with strategy; unclear business case; major stakeholder objections
- **Medium Risk**: Business case exists but uncertain; some stakeholder concerns
- **Low Risk**: Strong alignment; clear business value; stakeholder support secured

### De-Risking Activities
- Stakeholder interviews early and often
- Business case modeling with finance
- Legal/compliance review before deep investment
- Go-to-market planning with sales and marketing
- Operational readiness assessment

### Red Flags
- "We'll figure out the business model later"
- Building without stakeholder input
- Ignoring cost and scalability implications
- Surprising stakeholders late in the process
- Assuming viability because value exists

### Evidence to Gather
- Business case with financial projections
- Stakeholder sign-offs on key concerns
- Legal/compliance clearance
- Go-to-market plan from marketing/sales
- Support and operations readiness assessment

## 3. Usability Risk

**Definition**: Can users figure out how to use this?

### Key Questions
- Is the user experience intuitive?
- Can users accomplish their goals efficiently?
- Does this fit users' mental models?
- Are error messages and guidance clear?
- Is accessibility addressed?

### Assessment Criteria
- **High Risk**: Complex workflow; unfamiliar patterns; no user testing done
- **Medium Risk**: Standard patterns used; some testing; minor concerns identified
- **Low Risk**: User-tested design; proven patterns; positive usability feedback

### De-Risking Activities
- Low-fidelity prototypes tested with users
- High-fidelity mockups for detailed feedback
- Usability testing sessions
- A/B testing of design alternatives
- Accessibility reviews

### SVPG Context
Usability is the domain of product design expertise. Product managers should:
- Collaborate closely with designers (not do their job)
- Ensure designers have access to customers
- Participate in usability testing
- Respect design as a specialized discipline

### Red Flags
- "It's intuitive to me, so it must be intuitive"
- Skipping user testing to save time
- Product manager designing UI instead of collaborating with designer
- Complex workflows without user validation

### Evidence to Gather
- Usability test recordings and notes
- User task completion rates
- Time-on-task metrics
- User feedback and satisfaction scores
- Accessibility audit results

## 4. Feasibility Risk

**Definition**: Can we build this with the time, technology, and skills we have?

### Key Questions
- Do we have the technical capabilities?
- What's the realistic timeline?
- What are the technical dependencies and blockers?
- Do we have the right skills on the team?
- What's the technical debt or maintenance burden?

### Assessment Criteria
- **High Risk**: Unproven technology; missing skills; unclear architecture; major dependencies
- **Medium Risk**: Established tech but complex implementation; some unknowns
- **Low Risk**: Well-understood tech; team has experience; clear path forward

### De-Risking Activities
- Technical spikes and prototypes
- Architecture reviews
- Proof-of-concept implementations
- Performance testing
- Third-party integration validation

### SVPG Context
Feasibility is engineering's domain. Product managers should:
- Collaborate with engineers early (not hand off requirements)
- Include engineers in discovery
- Respect engineering judgment
- Understand trade-offs, not dictate technical solutions

### Red Flags
- "Engineering says it's easy" (without investigation)
- Promising delivery dates without engineering input
- Ignoring technical debt implications
- Product manager specifying technical implementation

### Evidence to Gather
- Engineering estimates with confidence levels
- Technical architecture proposals
- Proof-of-concept results
- Performance benchmarks
- Dependency analysis

## Balancing the Four Risks

### Common Imbalances

**Feasibility-only focus**: "Can we build it?" without asking if anyone wants it
- **Problem**: Builds things nobody uses
- **Fix**: Prioritize value risk assessment equally

**Usability-only focus**: "Is it easy to use?" without business viability
- **Problem**: Creates unsustainable products
- **Fix**: Validate business model and costs

**Value-only focus**: "Customers want it!" without viability or feasibility
- **Problem**: Commitments you can't keep
- **Fix**: Include stakeholders and engineers early

### Integrated Assessment

Good product teams assess all four risks simultaneously through:

1. **Cross-functional discovery**: PM, design, and engineering collaborate from day one
2. **Parallel learning**: Run experiments addressing multiple risks at once
3. **Rapid iteration**: Test cheapest/fastest methods first (prototypes before builds)
4. **Evidence-based decisions**: Gather real data, not opinions

### Risk Evolution

Risks change as you learn:
- **Early**: All four risks may be high
- **During discovery**: De-risk systematically through experiments
- **Before build**: Should have evidence reducing risk in all four areas
- **After launch**: Monitor for new risks (market changes, technical issues)

## Documenting Risk Assessment

For each risk, document:

```
Risk Type: [Value/Viability/Usability/Feasibility]

Current Assessment: [High/Medium/Low]

Evidence:
- [What data/feedback/tests inform this assessment?]

Remaining Unknowns:
- [What don't we know yet?]

De-Risking Plan:
- [What activities will reduce uncertainty?]
- [Timeline and owners]

Decision Criteria:
- [What evidence would make us confident enough to proceed?]
```

## Remember

- Product managers explicitly own **value** and **viability** risks
- All four risks must be assessed, not just feasibility and usability
- Discovery activities should address multiple risks in parallel
- Evidence beats opinion—gather real data from customers, stakeholders, and technical spikes
- Risk assessment is continuous, not one-time
